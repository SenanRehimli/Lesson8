        <p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Why do you hurt me,Michael?
            I've always been loyal to you. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power ,like a president or senator. 
            I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense.
            This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs.
